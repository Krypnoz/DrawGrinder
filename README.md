# DrawGrinder  ü§ñ
This is an Auto-Grinding bot made for PokeDraw. From the maker of PokeGrinder :)

## Supported features
This bot can currently handle :
1. Draw Cards
- It will just draw cards. It may or may not stop when 0 card slots are left, I haven't tested it much. Just made it 10 minutes ago.

## Installating

### On your PC
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Download this repo then unzip it.
3. Install the "rebase" branch of discord.py-self.
4. Install pyfiglet using pip install pyfiglet.
5. Paste your Dicord Auth Token, Username and the Channel ID you want to grind in inside `main.py`.

## Launching 
1. Run `main.py`.
2. Make sure to have enough card slots before starting.
3. The bot will take some time (depending on how many servers you are in) to start. When it is ready it will do /draw in the channel provided in `main.py`. Your grinding starts here :)

## Stoping
To stop the program simply close the command prompt.

## Disclamer ‚ö†Ô∏è
- I am of course not responsible for any ban you recieve for using this bot.
- Please keep an eye on the bot to solve captchas. Do not be irresponsible if you don't want to get banned.
- I may or may not respond to any issues on this bot. I am busy.
- I was just testing the rebase branch of discord.py-self without any intentions to make this bot. This bot will be fully developed after 10-12 days. That is when PokeGrinder will also be back :) Stay Tuned.
